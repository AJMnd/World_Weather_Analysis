# World_Weather_Analysis ✈️ 🌞 🏖️
When we created the following itinerary we wanted to ensure to find an ideal vacation spot for travelers. 

* First we generated a list of latitudes and longitudes once that was established we then narrowed down our list of destinations by weather. 

* Now we had a list of cities with ideal weather (65-80 🌡️) we then narrowed the search by proximity to hotels within the range of latitudes and longitudes. 

* lastly, we had the right city, wether, and hotel, so we provided directions via driving to a total of 4 destinations.
